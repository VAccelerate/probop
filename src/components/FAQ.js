      <h2>What if I want to add someone as a helper to my contacts list?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It might be helpful  to talk with the people  you trust and share
          that you are adding them to your Connekt nz contact list in case you ever
          need help. You can even show the Connekt nz App to them!
         </li>
        <li>
          Connekt nz will send them a text that says  they have been added as a
          helper and that they can look at the Connekt nz site for more information
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>What if I am not sure if I should make a Connekt nz Alert?</h2>
      <p>
        Your safety comes first!  If you think you may be unsafe or in danger
        it is always good to call out for help. There is a reason you feel that
        way. And we would rather you be safe than sorry.
      </p>
      <h2>What do I do if I get a Connekt nz Alert?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You can tell by the text you received where your friend is that asked
          for help...is it nearby? Is it safe for you to go there?  If yes, text
          back  that you are on your way and about how long it will take for you
          to get there
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is not safe for you to go alone where your friend  needs help,
          can you contact someone else to help you  get them?
          <ol type='a'>
            <li>
              or if is not safe for anyone to go this location can  you call and
              alert 111 for them
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>What do I say to my friend when I go to pick them up?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It&#39;s okay that we do not always know what to say. You can just say
          I am here to help you!  Where can I take you?
        </li>
        <li>
          And its up to them  if they want to talk about what is going on, or not.
          Being silent or talking about other things is okay, just follow your friends lead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you leave your friend in a safe place, it may not hurt to remind
          your friend  to press the I&#39;m Safe Now alert in the app ( so everyone
          knows they are okay now)  and  of the help lines linked in the Connekt nz App,
          if they are needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>What if there is no phone reception where I am?</h2>
      <p>
        If you trigger an alert and there is no phone reception  Connekt nz will
        notify you that there is no reception and to call 111 ( calling 111 always
        works.... even when there is no cell reception)

          the Connekt nz App

          UP is designed to  one day send information to 111 if people feel in
          danger. Because of this we try to  have information built into the
          system  that the police may require to help someone  requesting help.
